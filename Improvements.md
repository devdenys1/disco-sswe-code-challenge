# Improvements

_Author: Denys K._

This microservice implements the Company Postings API with a layered structure. Controllers, services, and repositories follow separation of concerns. An IoC container manages dependencies. Abstractions ensure flexibility, and tests provide coverage. To prepare it for production, several enhancements would strengthen it.

- **Filtering in Repository:** Choosing the best place for filtering postings logic depends on several factors. The current Postings API does not support filtering, so the service handles it now. Moving this logic to the repository could enhance the data access abstraction. If the Postings API later supports more efficient data retrieval, such as query parameters, the repository would manage this change seamlessly. This option keeps the adjustment contained and aligns with future growth, though it hinges on API updates and data volume.

- **API Retries:** External API calls might drop. Adding axios-retry for automatic retries keeps the service running despite network glitches. It boosts reliability without much effort.

- **Scalable Storage:** The test database suits this task. A robust database like MongoDB or a similar option along with ORM like Prisma eases data management. Indexing key fields such as IDs or names keeps queries fast as data scales.

- **Logging:** Using Winston tracks requests and errors for troubleshooting. Sending logs to a centralized store simplifies monitoring across instances.

- **Caching:** Storing lookups in node-cache skips repeat database calls. For heavier traffic, Redis with a 5-minute timeout scales it up cleanly.

- **Health Checks:** A /health endpoint shows if the service, API, and database are up. It offers a quick way to spot trouble.

- **Request Handling:** Rate limiting with express-rate-limit caps excessive calls. Pagination on GET with offset and limit manages big data. These keep the code responsive under load.

- **API Documentation:** Generating docs with Swagger clarifies endpoints for users. It keeps the API approachable and easy to integrate.

These changes build on the current design. They improve reliability, performance, and ease of maintenance. What to prioritize depends on traffic, runtime needs, and non-functional requirements.
